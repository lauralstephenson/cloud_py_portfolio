# Author Website Terraform Project

## The Project

I created this Terraform project to move an author website to Azure, containerize it, add a database for subscribers, add secrets to an Azure Key Vault, lock the Terraform file, and add listeners for both email opt-outs and the reader magnet.

## What I Learned
- How to use Terraform
- Azure
- Key Vault
- IAM
- Database
- Containers
- Email
- Listeners

This was quite the complicated project with many moving parts. I learned a huge amount about cloud computing, websites, email, keeping secrets and data safe, using identity management, and much more. I learned about both cloud computing and cybersecurity at the same time!

I also wrote a Medium article about the process.
