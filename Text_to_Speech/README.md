# Text to Speech Azure Project

This app uses Azure's text-to-speech service to help authors hear the voices of their characters and catch errors by listening to their work.

## What I Learned
- How to use Azure
- Azure's text-to-speech API
- How to set up a Python file to use the API and save it to a sound file

I also wrote a Medium article about this project, hoping it can be of use to others.

This project was both fun and useful!
