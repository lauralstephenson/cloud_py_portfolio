# Bulldozer Price Regression Model

## Project Overview

This is a machine learning model used to correctly predict the prices of bulldozers. The project was completed as part of Zero to Mastery's Machine Learning Course. The primary goal was to predict the future sale price of bulldozers using past data. This project demonstrates time series analysis, data preprocessing, and the implementation of a regression model using scikit-learn.

## What I Learned
- Google Colab
- Time Series Data
- Creating and sorting dataframes
- Cleaning up data, such as dealing with missing values
- Finding and turning categorical data into numbers
- Using scikit-learn
- Using a Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluating models using root mean squared log error (RMSLE)

## Unique Features
- Separating data by state: Prices will vary by state!

## Challenges and Solutions
- Ensuring that the tools and methods suggested by the instructor were up-to-date and functional. This involved extensive use of documentation, especially for scikit-learn.

## Results and Impact
- Successfully built a model that predicts bulldozer prices despite tool and version changes.
- Gained valuable experience in projecting future numbers based on current data. This skill is essential for various applications, such as predicting future temperatures from past data or forecasting car prices.
- Developed an understanding of the impact of external factors on projections, such as technological advancements affecting prices.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable experience in machine learning using numerical data and contributed to my overall growth as a data scientist. The insights gained from this project have real-world significance and applications in various fields.
