# Dog Breed Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview

This is a machine learning project to identify the breeds of dogs in photos. The project was completed as part of Zero to Mastery's Machine Learning course. The primary goal was to learn how to create a machine learning model using a Kaggle dataset. This project demonstrates multiclass classification and deep learning using photos by utilizing TensorFlow.

## What I Learned
- Google Colab
- Multi-class Classification
- Creating a training set
- Preprocessing images
- Creating callbacks to stop the model to prevent overfitting
- Creating a TensorBoard to visualize the data
- Creating a working machine learning model
- Evaluating and saving the model

## Unique Problems
- The main problem I faced was that, as with all things tech and especially in programming, I had to use the documentation to work with the most up-to-date tools. The instructor would suggest a tool, but I had to actually get the code to work!
- I had used Jupyter Notebooks in the past. Using Google Colab was interesting and fun. Once again, documentation is key!

## Results and Impact
- I got the project to work despite tool and version changes.
- I learned valuable lessons about using different tools and versions.
- I discovered that Kaggle datasets are fun to work with!

## Conclusion
This dataset was fun to work with because I love dogs! Having the model correctly identify dog breeds has real-world significance. There are apps that allow a user to take a picture, and the app will identify what is in the picture using a similar machine learning model. Machine learning has so many different applications, from using traffic flow data to inform city officials when to build new roads, to identifying plants while foraging. I look forward to learning more through these fascinating projects.
